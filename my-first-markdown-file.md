# Hello Markdown !

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done !


Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
